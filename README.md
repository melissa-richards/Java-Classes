## Exercise 1:
Create a dialogue box that asks the user a TRUE or FALSE question. When the user answers correctly, display a prompt that congratulates them. When the user answers incorrectly, display a message that notifies them of their defeat and then loops back to the beginning of the T/F question.

## Exercise 2:
In a new class called GuessNumber.Java, Create a dialogue box that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the program should check if the guess is higher or lower than the actual number. The program should continue asking the user to guess until they get the correct answer.

## Exercise 3:
Run the GuessNumber.java class inside of the App.java class. Have GuessNumber.java run after your True/False question.
